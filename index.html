            <p>Elon Musk is an inventor and an engineer. He is the owner of, among other things, Tesla Motors and SpaceX. Musk is a genius and will go down as one of the greatest engineers the world has ever seen.</p>
            <br>
            <p>He is pushing the boundaries of science and technology with his ambitions in electric power and space. 
            Like a true engineer, he has developed solutions for the problems of modern civilization. He has plans to solve our traffic problems with autonomous cars and tunnel networks.</p> 
            <br>
            <p>Perhaps more remarkable, he has plans to eliminate most of our fossil fuel dependence and switch to cleaner and more sustainable sources of energy.</p>
